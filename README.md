This repo is just for testing out potential components. 

At the moment it contains:
 - Language Translation Components

## Streamlining Translation

Ive created a Bilingual Layout Component that passes down the *t()* and *i18n* to all children. This way, you can always easily access i18next info via *this.props.t* or *this.props.i18n*. See *src/components/BilingualLayout.js* for more info.
